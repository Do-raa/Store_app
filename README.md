# Store_app 
In the representation attached above, you will find 9 slides . The first one includes the link to the source code in my GitHub account . 
The next slide contains an overview where I explained the goal of this application and how it works .
After that, I shared the diagram of the application and I explained the technologies used in a separated slide .
Then I shared the screenshots of each page of the website , indicating some explanations above them. In an other slide, I added a screencast video of the website .
Last but not least, you will find a summary of what has changed compared to my proposal.
